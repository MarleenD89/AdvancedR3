# AdvancedR3:

TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project uses the lipidomics dataset provided by the AdvancedR
course to learn about organizing project structures and collaborations.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: the lipidomics csv file
-   `doc/`: a learning qmd file with the script and a notes qmd with
    personal notes
-   `R/`: This folder contains custom functions or R scripts used for
    this project's analyses, such as in the `doc/` folder. Each R script
    is split up into sections (e.g. with RStudio's 'Insert Section' with
    Ctrl-Shift-R) by utility or purpose. You can use the 'Document
    Outline' (Ctrl-Shift-O) to see the sections and functions.

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_deps()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.
